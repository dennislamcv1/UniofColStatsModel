    "1. Read the questions carefully to understand what is being asked.\n",
    "2. When you feel that your work is completed, feel free to hit the ```Validate``` button to see your results on the *visible* unit tests. If you have questions about unit testing, please refer to the \"Module 0: Introduction\" notebook provided as an optional resource for this course. In this assignment, there are hidden unit tests that check your code. You will not recieve any feedback for failed hidden unit tests until the assignment is submitted. **Do not misinterpret the feedback from visible unit tests as all possible tests for a given question--write your code carefully!**\n",

Recall that a slope parameter in multiple linear regression is interpreted as the average change in the response for a *one-unit increase* in the value of the corresponding predictor, holding other predictors constant. But, for this problem, do we really care about how a \"one dollar increase in (yearly) salary\" impacts turtle rating? Probably not. It would be more convenient to interpret the change turtle rating with respect to bigger jumps in income, say, one thousand dollar increases. \n",
    "\n",
    "To better assess and interpret the affect of the predictors on `turtle_rating`, we can changes our scales! Let's start by centering our data, which requires setting the mean of each predictor equal to $0$ (note how that changes the interpretation of the intercept parameter!). To do this, we can subtract the mean value of each predictor from each value. So, for instance:\n",
