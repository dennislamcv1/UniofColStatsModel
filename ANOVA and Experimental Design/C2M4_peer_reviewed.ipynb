They are controlled to reduce variability, not to be examined for interactions. Testing for interactions would confound the main treatment effects with the block effects, making it difficult to interpret the results.\n",

    "- Reason: CRD is suitable here because it allows for a straightforward comparison of fertilizer effects.
