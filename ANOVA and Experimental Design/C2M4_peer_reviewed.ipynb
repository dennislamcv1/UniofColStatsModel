    "3. Understand how and when to apply different model strucutres for different experimental designs.\n",

    "\n",
    "1. Read the questions carefully to understand what is being asked.\n",
    "2. This work will be reviewed by another human, so make sure that you are clear and concise in what your explanations and answers."
