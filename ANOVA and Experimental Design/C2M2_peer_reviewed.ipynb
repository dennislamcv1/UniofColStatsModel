    "Consider a hardness testing machine that presses a rod with a pointed tip into a metal specimen with a known force. By measuring the depth of the depression caused by the tip, the hardness of the specimen is determined.\n",
    "\n",
    "Suppose we wish to determine whether or not four different tips produce different readings on a hardness testing machine. The experimenter has decided to obtain four observations on Rockwell C-scale hardness for each tip. There is only one factor - tip type - and a completely randomized single-factor design would consist of randomly assigning each one of the  4Ã—4=16  runs to an experimental unit, that is, a metal coupon, and observing the hardness reading that results. Thus, 16 different metal test coupons would be required in this experiment, one for each run in the design."
