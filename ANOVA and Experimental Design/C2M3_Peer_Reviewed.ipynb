    "In this assignment, we learn to answer our two-way ANOVA research questions through the analysis of real data. We will use the ereader data. The study that generated these data can be found here: [P.-C. Chang, S.-Y. Chou, K.-K. Shieh (2013). \"Reading Performance and Visual Fatigue When Using Electronic Displays in Long-Duration Reading Tasks Under Various Lighting Conditions,\" Displays, Vol. 34,\n",

    "Electronic paper display devices, such as the Amazon Kindle have changed the way that people read. But has it changed for the better? In a 2013 study titled \"Reading Performance and Visual Fatigue When Using Electronic Displays in Long-Duration Reading Tasks Under Various Lighting Conditions\", researchers set out to ask whether reading speed (a continuous variable) differed across different electronic paper displays. In addition, they were also interested in whether different lighting conditions impacted reading speed. As such, this experiment had one response with two different factors:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. Device type: three different types.\n",
    "    1. Sony PRS-700 with a 6-in. display, $800 \\times 600$ resolution; \n",
    "    2. Amazon Kindle DX with a 9.7-in. display, $1200 \\times 824$ resolution; and \n",
    "    3. iRex 1000S with a 10.2-in. display, $1024 \\times 1280$ resolution.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "2. Lighting Condition: four different conditions (200Lx,500Lx, 1000Lx, 1500Lx), Lx = lux, one lumen per square meter\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "3. Reading Time: measured in seconds.\n",
    "\n",
    "With these data, we might ask the following **research questions**:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. Are the effects of device type significant? That is, is there evidence that suggests that individuals read at different speeds based on the device that they are using?\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "2. Are the effects of lighting conditions significant? That is, is there evidence that suggests that individuals read at different speeds based on the reading lighting conditions?\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "3. Do device type and lighting conditions *interact*? For example, Suppose that, on average, people can read for longer on device A than on device B, in low light. Is that trend the same in medium light, or bright light? If not, for example, if B is better than A in bright light, then type and lighting interact.\n",
